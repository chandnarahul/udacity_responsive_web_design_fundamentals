Add view port
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    view port = user visible area of web page
    device-width = width of the page to follow device screen width
    initial-scale = set the initial zoom level when the page is loaded
                    this means 1 css pixel is equal to 1 viewport pixel

Element widths = use % in width instead of px
