Breakpoints:        Start small and slowly increase page width.
                    Stop when the NAV or Other elements are big enough and have started to take up more space than it is actually required
                    Or when you see that it is just space that is increasing and not the content size.

Media Queries:      When the media query should kick in;
                    Only till 400px = @media screen and (max-width: 400px)
                    Greater than 300px but less than 601px = @media screen and (min-width: 301px) and (max-width: 600px)

Grid Fluid System:  bootstrap or 960 layout.   

Box Container:      Normal Block Layout each div inside the container div are positioned underneath the other one.    

Flex box Container:  Fills the space available (expands/shrinks)
                    add display:flex; to container div
                    All div now show in a row, because by default the flex direction is row.
                    by default flex items fit on a single line, no matter the width the items wont wrap.
                    Browser would size them to fit within the viewport.
                    Change that by adding flex-wrap: wrap; (telling browser) it is okay to wrap.
